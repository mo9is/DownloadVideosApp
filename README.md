This a sample project app in SwiftUI, Combine and uses MVVM architecture to fetch data from a sample JSON and display it in a horizontal scroll view inside the app. 

It has been developed in a tab bar interface where you can download mutiple videos (in a queue) and store it in a local storage to play it for the next time (supports offline playing). 

You can also delete the videos once downloaded. Videos, once downloaded can be automatically be played from the local storage, otherwise they play from the server URL itself.
